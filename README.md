# SMART-GROCERY-SHOPPING-ASSISTANT
The Smart Grocery Shopping Assistant is an interactive Shiny web application designed to simplify and enhance the grocery shopping experience. It enables users to select items, choose brands, specify quantities, and manage their cart with options to add, remove, or clear items. The app provides real-time summaries of total cost, item metrics, and visualizes spending through dynamic charts. It integrates a machine learning model (Random Forest) to predict stock availability and uses the Apriori algorithm to recommend frequently bought-together item combos, offering a smart, data-driven shopping experience.
